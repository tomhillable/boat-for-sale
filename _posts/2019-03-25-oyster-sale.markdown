**£12,650 - Priced to sell.**  
Our trusty Westerly Konsort, Oyster, is offered for sale as we are upgrading to a liveaboard cruiser.  We have had some great adventures on her with our kids and hope to find her a new home for this sailing season. 
  
Oyster is a great example of Westerly’s popular, comfortable and safe cruiser. With her steadfast and sturdy performance, she is a durable and trustworthy yacht.  She is solid in all conditions, easy to handle and has a spacious and practical interior - brilliant for family cruising and shorthanded sailing alike.

Oyster has been well looked-after and has benefitted from many upgrades and replacements including new standing rigging (2018) and new sails (late 2017, used from July 2018), new non-skid deck paint (2018), and new starter and house batteries (2018).  Oyster is newly scrubbed and antifouled with newly serviced winches and new anodes (all April 2019).  She is lying in Gosport is ready to sail and a full and recent survey is available on request.
